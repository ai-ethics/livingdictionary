# The Living Dictionary 

The Living Dictionary was designed by MAIEI to empower, motivate, and inspire you to engage more deeply in the field of AI Ethics. With technical terms exaplained in common language, the Living Dictionary will surely make the field more accessible for people without a technical background. The goal with the Living Dictionary is that it encourage you to begin challenging AI developments that can, if we're not careful, hurt us. 

Let's do this together!

If there is a word you'd like us to define next please let us know in [this form](https://airtable.com/shrB3tKSE2MUqPbBv)! We would love to know what you want defined so that we can make the Living Dictionary as useful as possible.
