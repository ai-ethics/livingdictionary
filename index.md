# The Living Dictionary 

The Living Dictionary was designed by MAIEI to inspire and empower you to engage more deeply in the field of AI Ethics. With technical computer science and social science terms explained in plain language, the Living Dictionary will surely make the field of AI ethics more accessible, no prior knowledge necessary! We hope that the Living Dictionary will encourage you to join us in shaping the trajectory of ethical, safe and inclusive AI development.

Each week we will be releasing a new definition. But, if there are specific terms you'd like us to define, please let us know in [this form](https://airtable.com/shrB3tKSE2MUqPbBv). 

Help us make the Living Dictionary as useful as possible in our pursuit to democratize the AI space, one definition at a time.
